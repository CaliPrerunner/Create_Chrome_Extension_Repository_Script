Chrome Extension Directory and File Creator
Author: Marco Robles
Date: 7-June-2024

This is a simple bash script that creates directories and files for a Chrome extension. It can be used in two ways:
    If no target directory is specified, it will use the current directory to create the files.
    If a specific directory is provided as an argument, it will create the files in that directory.

Usage

    Run the script without any arguments:

    ./create_extension.sh

    This will use the current directory to create the necessary files.

    Run the script with a specific target directory:

    ./create_extension.sh /path/to/your/directory

    This will create the files in the specified directory.

Enjoy!
